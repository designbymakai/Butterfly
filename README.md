## Overview

The Butterfly homepage offers a clear, concise overview of your day so you can hit the ground running. It shows a thumbnail of your calendar events, a daily agenda with tasks and events, and a summary of active tasks (including those due today). The AI Assistant takes center stage for quick add/update/prioritize flows and guidance on what to focus on.

Butterfly was designed with **accessibility in mind**, especially for adults in the workplace who are **neurodivergent and have ADHD**. By minimizing distractions and providing clear direction, it helps users reduce task paralysis and focus on what matters most.  

This project was my **final-year capstone** for my Design degree at the **University of Auckland** and was featured in [**Design Assembly’s Hot New Things**](https://designassembly.org.nz/2025/08/01/2025-hot-new-things-makai-ingalls-university-of-auckland/).

### Key Features
- **Daily Agenda** – Quick overview of tasks and events for the day  
- **Calendar Snapshot** – At-a-glance events  
- **Task Summary** – Active + due-today  
- **AI Assistant** – Add, change, prioritize, get advice
